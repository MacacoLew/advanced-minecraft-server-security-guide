### Introduction
##### What is this guide for?
This guide is created with the sole purpose of protecting our server against exploit abuse that could damage the server or network.  
With this guide you can block most exploits and bugs that the Grieffers (A.K.A Skiddies) use to break our cubes.  

##### Why do I need to secure my server?
If you search on Google "Grief minecraft server" this will give you enough reason to protect your server, in summary you run the risk that your account is compromised or that hacked clients can attack your vulnerable minecraft server/network.  

##### What I need?
You don't need much knowledge, try to know at least: how plugins are installed, how they are configured, how ports work, how servers and packets work. Also to improve security I recommend not using host pages, use a VPS or Dedicated (Best option)

#### Disclaimer
It is impossible to block all exploits, most of the grief is due to the stupidity of the owners, administrators or who has made a patent configuration of the server as the fact of using plugins with bypasses or configuring them incorectly.  
Nor do I promise you that your network/server will be completely inescapable, nor will I be responsible for any damage you do to your server with this guide. (If you follow everything to the letter nothing bad will happen)
